# Changelog

## Module 1 - Properties and units (current)
- New `properties` app: Owner, Property and Unit models with Unfold admin pages
- Property page shows its units inline; Property list shows unit and vacant counts
- Unit list with colour status badges and filters (status, type, property, furnished)
- Sidebar section "Property management" (each item appears only for users with permission)
- Sample data: 3 owners, 4 properties, 88 units; demo roles receive permissions
- Erase all data also removes owners, properties and units
- Run `python manage.py makemigrations` then `migrate` after extracting

## Module 0 - Foundation
- Django project (`config/`) with SQLite and the Unfold admin theme, UAE time zone (Asia/Dubai)
- `core` app:
  - Users and Roles (groups) managed by superusers only, so the superuser can create other users
  - "Data tools" page in the admin sidebar (superuser only):
    - Seed sample data (4 roles + 4 demo staff users, safe to run repeatedly)
    - Erase all data (type ERASE to confirm; superusers are never deleted)
  - Same tools from the terminal: `python manage.py seed_data` and `python manage.py erase_data`
  - A registry (`core/data_registry.py`) so every future module adds its own sample data and eraser automatically

2. Tenants and leases
3. Rent invoicing and payments (cheques, bank transfers, cash)
